A simple demo application using PyQt5 for creating HMIs in ROS2.

---

## Usage Instruction

1. Clone this repository in the root of your ROS2 workspace: `git clone https://github.com/sampreets3/simple_gui`
1. Install the necessary dependencies of the package: `pip3 install pyqt5`
1. Build the package at the root of your workspace: `colcon build --packages-select simple_gui`
1. Source the setup file from the root of your workspace: `source install/setup.bash`
1. Open a terminal and start the HMI using : `ros2 run simple_gui ros2_hmi_node`

This should open up a small HMI as shown below:

## Modify the Application

You need to install the application Qt Designer on your computer in order to edit the `simple_gui/simple.ui` file. If you have the application installed, and you click on the ui file, it should take you directly to the Qt Designer window. 

Once you have finished making your modifications, you can save the ui _(Ctrl+S)_, and come back to the `simple_gui` module. You can generate the `simple_gui.py` file from this ui file by using the `pyuic5` tool :

```sh
pyuic5 -x simple.ui -o simple_gui.py
# Note that we are in the simple_gui/simple_gui directory while doing this operation
```

From there on, you can continue to edit the `gui_ros_node` file, in order to define the event callbacks and other modifications you might want to make. It is advised to always name the elements you create _(PushButtons, TextLabels, etc.)_, so that you can very easily refer to them as inside the `MyGuiNode` class as `self.ui.<name-of-push-button>, self.ui.<name-of-textlabel>`, and so on.

The rest of the package should not need to be changed, unless you want to add some helper files inside the module. Then you should add them into the `setup.py` file in the `py_modules` section.
